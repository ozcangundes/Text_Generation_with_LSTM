# Text_Generation_with_LSTM

In this project, I tried to generate Turkish text via LSTM network implemented by PyTorch library.

Dataset is crawled via Beautifulsoup framework in Python and it consists of 33 text file which has the public speeches of one of the political leaders in Turkey.

Model codes can be found in [here](https://github.com/ozcangundes/Text_Generation_with_LSTM/blob/master/LSTM_ile_Konu%C5%9Fma_%C3%9Cretimi.ipynb)

Medium blog link is [here](https://medium.com/@ozcangundes/lstm-dil-modeli-ile-metin-%C3%BCretimi-6c004e2931d9).

LSTM is quite effective and easy-to-implement for this task. But it is crucial to have larger training data than mine. Also, you can try transformer based architectures like GPT-2.

If you have any questions regarding to the topic or the codes, please feel free to [contact](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%B6zcan-g%C3%BCnde%C5%9F-7693055b/) me to add them to this list.
